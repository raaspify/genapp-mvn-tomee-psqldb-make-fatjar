<p>Re:fine tuning website ${yxxxuh56userHome.instance.zzxxu2oxxhxxxxxxxxxxowner2} </p>
<p>Dear admin,</p>
<p style="font-family:arial;color:red;font-size:20px;">Congratulation, the new website ${yxxxuh56userHome.instance.zzxxu2oxxhxxxxxxxxxxowner2} is activated now. </p>
<p style="font-family:arial;color:black;font-size:30px;">It also means there will be visitors to your site and you want this site to be of interest to them.</p>
<br/>
<p>Note. If you already have a customer facing site and this is to be used for backoffice functions, you may skip step1. </p>
<p style="font-family:arial;color:black;font-size:20px;">Step 1. Update the contents like About Us, News etc to reflect your organization. </p>
<p>Create folder and subfolders on your personal computer or tablet and store related pictures and text for the site contents as well as for the products you will be offering for ECommerce. </p>
<p>Login as manager or admin and use setups/website customization for content updates and user setup</p>
<p>Use Add/List/Report then Add then Item menue for online shopping cart items. Create an item with type shopping-category and save it. Then use the New button to create another item but item type shopping-item and make sure to pick the category item just created as ItemAsParent.  </p>
<p>As you add these items, visitor menues will appear as there is some thing to show to them</p>
<p>items Currency code and symbol shown can be edited using Setups/Client menu</p>

<br/>
<p>Step 2. You should add new back office users and give them different roles and levels. Roles and levels control what menue options are available to them.</p>
<p>Suppliers and Customers should be added. Later you can use the Mailing to send marketing materials.</p>
<p>Step 3. You should do your own test to make sure the process works and take backups available under Tools</p>
<p>Reference manual is available under ContactUs. Tutorials are under Tools</p>
<p>Under tools there are third party tools for image editing and touch ups to make your site more attractive</p>
<p>The site theme and menu sizes and fonts can be changed under website customization menue</p>
